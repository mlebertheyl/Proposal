	abstract = {Reef fishes are an exceptionally speciose vertebrate assemblage, yet the main drivers of their diversification remain unclear. It has been suggested that Miocene reef rearrangements promoted opportunities for lineage diversification, however, the specific mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we assemble near-complete reef fish phylogenies to assess the importance of ecological and geographical factors in explaining lineage origination patterns. We reveal that reef fish diversification is strongly associated with species’ trophic identity and body size. Large-bodied herbivorous fishes outpace all other trophic groups in recent diversification rates, a pattern that is consistent through time. Additionally, we show that omnivory acts as an intermediate evolutionary step between higher and lower trophic levels, while planktivory represents a common transition destination. Overall, these results suggest that Miocene changes in reef configurations were likely driven by, and subsequently promoted, trophic innovations. This highlights trophic evolution as a key element in enhancing reef fish diversification.},

	abstract = {Past environmental changes are expected to have profoundly impacted diversity dynamics through time. While some previous studies showed an association between past climate changes or tectonic events and important shifts in lineage diversification, it is only recently that past environmental changes have been explicitly integrated in diversification models to test their influence on diversification rates. Here, we used a global reconstruction of tropical reef habitat dynamics during the Cenozoic and phylogenetic diversification models to test the influence of (i) major geological events, (ii) reef habitat fragmentation and (iii) reef area on the diversification of 9 major clades of tropical reef fish (Acanthuridae, Balistoidea, Carangoidea, Chaetodontidae, Haemulinae, Holocentridae, Labridae, Pomacentridae and Sparidae). The diversification models revealed a weak association between paleo-habitat changes and diversification dynamics. Specifically, the fragmentation of tropical reef habitats over the Cenozoic was found to be a driver of tropical reef fish diversification for 2 clades. However, overall, our approach did not allow the identification of striking associations between diversification dynamics and paleo-habitat fragmentation in contrast with theoretical model’s predictions.},

              Deep-sea benthic foraminifera preserve an essential record of Earth's past climate in their oxygen- and carbon-isotope compositions. However, this record lacks sufficient temporal resolution and/or age control in some places to determine which climate forcing and feedback mechanisms were most important. Westerhold
              et al.
              present a highly resolved and well-dated record of benthic carbon and oxygen isotopes for the past 66 million years. Their reconstruction and analysis show that Earth's climate can be grouped into discrete states separated by transitions related to changing greenhouse gas levels and the growth of polar ice sheets. Each climate state is paced by orbital cycles but responds to variations in radiative forcing in a state-dependent manner.

            Much of our understanding of Earth’s past climate comes from the measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Yet, long intervals in existing records lack the temporal resolution and age control needed to thoroughly categorize climate states of the Cenozoic era and to study their dynamics. Here, we present a new, highly resolved, astronomically dated, continuous composite of benthic foraminifer isotope records developed in our laboratories. Four climate states—Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, Icehouse—are identified on the basis of their distinctive response to astronomical forcing depending on greenhouse gas concentrations and polar ice sheet volume. Statistical analysis of the nonlinear behavior encoded in our record reveals the key role that polar ice volume plays in the predictability of Cenozoic climate dynamics.},

Therefore, ideally, fossil data should be included in evolutionary, macroecological and biogeographical studies.

The goal of the Paleobiology Database is to make these records generally accessible, but unlike databases such as Genbank and GBIF, a ready-made interface to the R computing environment has not been available. We have developed paleobioDB, an R package designed to perform easy and flexible queries of the Paleobiology Database, including visualization, downloading and processing of selected data. This package facilitates access to paleontological data in a way that should allow further analysis using other packages and libraries available in R. The paleobioDB package should facilitate the integration of paleontological and neontological datasets, so that data from the deep past can be used to help inform our understanding of living biota, and vice versa.},

	abstract = {When threatened with predation, foraging prey can cease feeding and seek refuge or shift to feeding sites (microhabitats) offering increased safety. Predator-induced microhabitat shifts by large herbivores are of interest to ecologists because spatial patterns of foraging by these animals shape plant communities. The influence of predation risk on microhabitat use by large herbivores in marine systems remains poorly understood. We explored the relationship between microhabitat use by dugongs, Dugong dugon, and tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier, predation risk in an Australian embayment over 3 years. Use by foraging dugongs of two seagrass microhabitats, edge (lower-quality seagrass, swift escape from sharks) and interior (higher-quality seagrass, fewer escape options), was monitored in seven survey zones. We indexed predation danger using catch rates of tiger sharks that were greater than 3.0m in total length. The degree of dissimilarity between forager densities in edge and interior microhabitats was a function of tiger shark abundance: foragers underused edge (safe) microhabitat when sharks were scarce, overused it when sharks were common, and responded to daily changes in shark abundance in a threat-sensitive fashion, showing the greatest preference for edges when shark abundance was highest. We conclude that dugongs manage their probability of death by allocating more time to safe but lower-quality feeding microhabitats when the likelihood of encountering sharks is elevated. Dugong grazing can influence seagrass biomass and patch composition, so tiger sharks probably affect the microhabitat structure of seagrass meadows, and ultimately their benthic communities, indirectly by altering the way that dugongs use feeding patches.},

We examined effects of tide height and time of day on the dugong's distance from 1) the nearest coast, 2) water {\textgreater}3 m deep, 3) actual water depth (bathymetry tide ht) experienced, and 4) distribution of the directions of movements. Both tidal and diel cycles influenced dugong movement. Tracked dugongs tended to be closer to shore at high tide than at low tide and closer to shore at night than during the day. Onshore movement was more prevalent on incoming tides and in the afternoon and evening. Offshore movement was more prevalent on outgoing tides and from midnight through the morning until midday. Tidal and diel variation in water depths used by the inshore–intertidal dugongs was small, but probably underestimated, hidden by a sampling bias in the telemetry equipment. Onshore movement at high tide allowed dugongs to exploit intertidal seagrass beds. Dugongs are closer to shore in afternoons and evenings than in mornings. This behavior may be related to the avoidance of predators or watercraft. Our findings can be used to predict spatial patterns of dugongs within areas of conservation management significance and to assess, avoid, and mitigate adverse effects of anthropogenic disturbance.},

	abstract = {Predators can influence plants indirectly by altering spatial patterns of herbivory, so studies assessing the relationship between perceived predation risk and habitat use by herbivores may improve our understanding of community organization. In marine systems, the effects of predation danger on space use by large herbivores have received little attention, despite the possibility that predator-mediated alterations in patterns of grazing by these animals influence benthic community structure. We evaluated the relationship between habitat use by foraging dugongs (Dugong dugon) and the threat of tiger shark predation in an Australian embayment (Shark Bay) between 1997 and 2004. Dugong densities were quantified in shallow (putatively dangerous) and deep (putatively safe) habitats (seven survey zones allocated to each habitat), and predation hazard was indexed using catch rates of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier); seagrass volume provided a measure of food biomass within each zone. Overall, dugongs selected shallow habitats, where their food is concentrated. Foragers used shallow and deep habitats in proportion to food availability (input matching) when large tiger sharks were scarce and overused deep habitats when sharks were common. Furthermore, strong synchrony existed between daily measures of shark abundance and the extent to which deep habitats were overused. Thus, dugongs appear to adaptively manage their risk of death by allocating time to safe but impoverished foraging patches in proportion to the likelihood of encountering predators in profitable but more dangerous areas. This apparent food-safety trade-off has important implications for seagrass community structure in Shark Bay, as it may result in marked temporal variability in grazing pressure.},

We explored this phenomenon in dugongs (Dugong dugon) subject to spatially and temporally variable risk of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) predation in Shark Bay, Australia. Dugong behaviour was assayed using focal follows and organised into sequences of foraging, resting, and travelling bouts. We used log-linear analysis to test for sequence differences in relation to habitat (deep, shallow) and predation danger (sharks present, largely absent). Dugongs modified their behavioural sequences between periods of high and low shark abundance: those at risk alternated more frequently between foraging, which constrains anti-predator vigilance, and travelling, which facilitates predator detection. Dugongs also avoided continuous series of resting bouts, during which awareness is reduced, when sharks were present. These changes were only observed in relatively dangerous shallow habitat, which is hunted disproportionately by tiger sharks; behavioural responses to sharks in deep habitat were modest. We conclude that dugongs in risky habitat resort to safer behavioural sequences in response to sharks. Given that human disturbance and predators are perceived similarly by many species, some forms of vessel interaction could compromise the fitness of sirenians by eliciting similar behavioural adjustment.},

Specifically, we tested the a priori hypothesis that pied cormorants (Phalacrocorax varius Gmelin, 1789) would modify their use of shallow seagrass habitats in a manner opposite to that of previously studied dolphins (Tursiops aduncus Ehrenberg, 1833), dugongs (Dugong dugon Müller, 1776), and green turtles (Chelonia mydas Linnaeus, 1758) because, unlike these species, the effectiveness of cormorant escape behaviour does not vary spatially. 5 As predicted, cormorants used interior and edge portions of banks proportional to the abundance of their potential prey when sharks were absent but shifted to interior portions of banks to minimize encounters with tiger sharks as predation risk increased. Other shark prey, however, shift to edge microhabitats when shark densities increase to take advantage of easier escape despite higher encounter rates with sharks. 6 The interaction of landscape features and escape ability likely is important in diverse communities. 7 When escape probabilities are high in habitats with high predator density, risk effects of predators can reverse the direction of commonly assumed indirect effects of top predators. 8 The interaction between landscape features and prey escape tactics can result in a single predator species having differential effects on their sympatric prey that could cascade through ecosystems and should be incorporated into a general framework for context dependence of risk effects.},

The software PyRate implements a Bayesian framework to analyze fossil occurrence data to estimate the rates of preservation, origination, and extinction while incorporating several sources of uncertainty. Building upon this framework, we present a suite of methodological advances including more complex and realistic models of preservation and the first likelihood-based test to compare the fit across different models. Further, we develop a new reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate origination and extinction rates and their temporal variation, which provides more reliable results and includes an explicit estimation of the number and temporal placement of statistically significant rate changes. Finally, we implement a new C++ library that speeds up the analyses by orders of magnitude, therefore facilitating the application of the PyRate methods to large data sets. We demonstrate the new functionalities through extensive simulations and with the analysis of a large data set of Cenozoic marine mammals. We compare our analytical framework against two widely used alternative methods to infer origination and extinction rates, revealing that PyRate decisively outperforms them across a range of simulated data sets. Our analyses indicate that explicit statistical model testing, which is often neglected in fossil-based macroevolutionary analyses, is crucial to obtain accurate and robust results.},

Moreover, we develop a new birth–death model to correlate the variation of speciation/extinction rates with changes of a continuous trait. Finally, we demonstrate the use of Bayes factors for model selection and show how the posterior estimates of a PyRate analysis can be used to generate calibration densities for Bayesian molecular clock analysis. PyRate is an open-source command-line Python program available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyrate/.},

We build on the recent literature by developing a framework to describe the effects these changes will have on marine megafauna. With the goal to assist policymakers and grass roots organizers, we identify three illustrative pathways by which climate change drives these range shifts: (1) effects on habitat and shelter, (2) impacts on reproduction and disease, and (3) changing distribution of sources of food. We examine non-climate factors that may constrain or enable megafauna to adapt, creating winners and losers both for the species and the people dependent upon them. Finally, we comment on what management strategies exist at international and local scales that could help mitigate these impacts of climate change so that we, as a global community, can ensure that marine megafauna and people can best co-exist in a changing world.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to analyze the distribution of manatees, dolphins and sea turtles off northeastern Brazil through aerial surveys, relating them to speciﬁc habitats and human activities, with emphasis on marine protected areas (MPAs). Surveys were conducted between January and April 2010 at 150 m altitude and 140 km hÀ1, using two independent observers. Strip transects were ﬂown in a zigzag pattern. Transects covered 4026 km in more than 27 ﬂight hours. A total of 36 sightings of manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus, 41 individuals), 28 of dolphins (Delphinidae, 78 individuals, including 10 Sotalia guianensis) and 256 of sea turtles (Cheloniidae, 286 individuals) were recorded. Manatees and sea turtles displayed solitary habits, while dolphins were commonly seen in groups. Manatees were positively correlated with sea turtles, probably due to their preference for sheltered shallow habitats with favorable conditions for foraging and resting. Furthermore, manatees showed a positive relationship with mangrove estuaries, and medium-sized coastal cities probably due to the intense urban development in many estuarine areas. Manatees and sea turtles were also positively correlated with boats, showing a severe threat for these species. Density of manatees was signiﬁcantly higher within MPAs with preserved mangrove estuaries than in non-protected areas, while dolphins and sea turtles were observed in high densities MPAs with coral reefs. The elevated density of these organisms shows the vital importance of protecting and adequately managing unique ecosystems to ensure a sustainable future for the populations of severely threatened species.},

	abstract = {Aerial survey methods for census of wildlife populations are widely used to manage species. There has been considerable research to develop methods to cope with imperfect detection during aerial surveys, however misidentification remains an unresolved but significant issue. Using data from a comprehensive dugong aerial survey of the coastline of the Northern Territory, Australia, we assessed the influence of observer, sighting and environmental variables on probabilities of both observers in double-count, dual-observer teams detecting dugongs and dolphins (‘duplicate sighting probability’), the confidence with which observers could distinguish between dugongs and dolphins, and the reliability of post-detection observations by comparing data between observers. Dolphin duplicate sighting probability varied dependent on group size, Beaufort sea state and the lateral position inside the strip-width transect in relation to the aircraft. Dugong duplicate sighting probability varied across dual-observer teams. Counts of individuals in dugong and dolphin groups were unreliable past ≈5 individuals. Observer confidence in taxon identification varied by individual observer and throughout the duration of the survey (dolphin sightings) and potentially by the lateral position inside the transect strip-width in relation to the aircraft (dugong sightings). The probability of taxon identification disagreement between observers for duplicate dugong and dolphin sightings varied with group size, and markedly if one observer was uncertain (i.e. not 100\% confident) of their assigned taxon. We believe this is predominately due to the presence of Australian snubfin dolphins (Orcaella heinsohni) in the survey area, which look like dugongs when seen from a distance, momentarily. We further show that application of different data filtering scenarios for uncertain taxonomic identifications and taxon identification disagreements between dual observers produces highly variable estimates of observer-specific dugong detection probability (ranging from 0.26 to 0.80 in a single observer) and dugong abundance (x̅ ± S.D., 40\% ± 25\%: difference between highest and lowest estimate, relative to the lowest estimate, across different data filtering scenarios). These results are particularly relevant not only to researchers conducting dugong aerial surveys, but also for other marine mammal aerial surveys in passing mode that target sympatric, morphologically similar species. We recommend development of operating procedures and analytical methods to quantify and adjust for misidentification and uncertain taxon identifications.},

Regular surveys are used to this purpose followed often by a manual counting process. This paper proposes an algorithm for automatic detection of dugongs from imagery taken in aerial surveys. Our algorithm exploits the fact that dugongs are rare in most images, therefore we determine regions of interest partially based on color rarity. This simple observation makes the system robust to changes in illumination. We also show that by applying the extended-maxima transform on red-ratio images, submerged dugongs with very fuzzy edges can be detected. Performance ﬁgures obtained here are promising in terms of degree of conﬁdence in the detection of marine species, but more importantly our approach represents a signiﬁcant step in automating this type of surveys.},

Dugong and calf data were obtained from standardized aerial surveys conducted along the study region. A range of lagged versions of each of the focal climatic drivers (1 to 4 years) were included in a global model containing the proportion of calves in each population crossed with each of the lagged versions of the climatic drivers to explore relationships. The relative influence of each predictor was estimated via Gibbs variable selection. The relationships between the proportion of dependent calves and the climatic drivers varied spatially and temporally, with climatic drivers influencing calf counts at sub-regional scales. Thus we recommend that the assessment of and management response to indirect climatic threats on dugongs should also occur at sub-regional scales.},

	abstract = {Aerial surveys of marine mammals are routinely conducted to assess and monitor species’ habitat use and population status. In Australia, dugongs (Dugong dugon) are regularly surveyed and long-term datasets have formed the basis for defining habitat of high conservation value and risk assessments of human impacts. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may facilitate more accurate, human-risk free, and cheaper aerial surveys. We undertook the first Australian UAV survey trial in Shark Bay, western Australia. We conducted seven flights of the ScanEagle UAV, mounted with a digital SLR camera payload. During each flight, ten transects covering a 1.3 km2 area frequently used by dugongs, were flown at 500, 750 and 1000 ft. Image (photograph) capture was controlled via the Ground Control Station and the capture rate was scheduled to achieve a prescribed 10\% overlap between images along transect lines. Images were manually reviewed post hoc for animals and scored according to sun glitter, Beaufort Sea state and turbidity. We captured 6243 images, 627 containing dugongs. We also identified whales, dolphins, turtles and a range of other fauna. Of all possible dugong sightings, 95\% (CI = 90\%, 98\%) were subjectively classed as ‘certain’ (unmistakably dugongs). Neither our dugong sighting rate, nor our ability to identify dugongs with certainty, were affected by UAV altitude. Turbidity was the only environmental variable significantly affecting the dugong sighting rate. Our results suggest that UAV systems may not be limited by sea state conditions in the same manner as sightings from manned surveys. The overlap between images proved valuable for detecting animals that were masked by sun glitter in the corners of images, and identifying animals initially captured at awkward body angles. This initial trial of a basic camera system has successfully demonstrated that the ScanEagle UAV has great potential as a tool for marine mammal aerial surveys.},

Emerging from the 12th International Seagrass Biology Workshop, held in October 2016, has been the view that grazing marine megafauna may play a useful role in helping to identify previously unknown seagrass habitats. Here we describe this concept, showing how detailed information on the distribution of both dugongs (Dugong dugon) and green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) obtained, for example, by aerial surveys and satellite tracking, can reveal new information on the location of seagrass meadows. We show examples of how marine megaherbivores have been effective habitat indicators, revealing major, new, deep-water seagrass meadows and offering the potential for more informed estimates of seagrass extent in tropical and sub-tropical regions where current information is often lacking.},

Relative biomass of krill feeders (i.e. minke whales, whale sharks, manta rays) were related to SST, Chl-a and bathymetry (model [AICc] weight = 0.45) and the model combining these variables explained a relatively large amount (32.3\%) of the variation in relative biomass. Relative biomass of fish/cephalopod feeders (dolphins, sharks) were weakly correlated with changes in SST, whereas that of other invertebrate/macroalgal feeders (turtles, dugong) was weakly correlated with changes in steepness of the shelf (bathymetry gradient).

	abstract = {Monitoring abundance and distribution of organisms over large landscapes can be difﬁcult. Because of challenges associated with logistics and data analyses uncorrected counts are often used as a proxy for abundance. We present the ﬁrst statewide estimate of abundance for Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) using an innovative approach that combines multiple sources of information. We used a combination of a double-observer protocol, repeated passes, and collection of detailed diving behavior data to account for imperfect detection of animals. Our estimate of manatee abundance was 6350 (95\%CI: 5310–7390). Speciﬁcally, we estimated 2790 (95\%CI: 2160–3540) manatees on the west coast (2011), and 3560 (95\%CI: 2850–4410) on the east coast (2012). Unlike uncorrected counts conducted since 1991, our estimation method considered two major sources of error: spatial variation in distribution and imperfect detection. The Florida manatee is listed as endangered, but its status is currently under review; the present study may become important for the review process. Interestingly, we estimated that 70\% (95\%CI: 60–80\%) of manatees on the east coast of Florida were aggregated in one county during our survey. Our study illustrates the value of combining information from multiple sources to monitor abundance at large scales. Integration of information can reduce cost, facilitate the use of data obtained from new technologies to increase accuracy, and contribute to encouraging coordination among survey teams from different organizations nationally or internationally. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our work to other conservation applications (e.g., risk assessment) and to other systems.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the need to estimate the abundance of marine mammal populations to inform conservation assessments, especially relating to ﬁshery bycatch, this paper provides background on abundance estimation and reviews the various methods available for pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians. We ﬁrst give an “entrylevel” introduction to abundance estimation, including fundamental concepts and the importance of recognizing sources of bias and obtaining a measure of precision. Each of the primary methods available to estimate abundance of marine mammals is then described, including data collection and analysis, common challenges in implementation, and the assumptions made, violation of which can lead to bias. The main method for estimating pinniped abundance is extrapolation of counts of animals (pups or all-ages) on land or ice to the whole population. Cetacean and sirenian abundance is primarily estimated from transect surveys conducted from ships, small boats or aircraft. If individuals of a species can be recognized from natural markings, mark-recapture analysis of photo-identiﬁcation data can be used to estimate the number of animals using the study area. Throughout, we cite example studies that illustrate the methods described. To estimate the abundance of a marine mammal population, key issues include: deﬁning the population to be estimated, considering candidate methods based on strengths and weaknesses in relation to a range of logistical and practical issues, being aware of the resources required to collect and analyze the data, and understanding the assumptions made. We conclude with a discussion of some practical issues, given the various challenges that arise during implementation.},

            Brandon, J. R., Breiwick, J. M., Punt, A. E., and Wade, P. R. 2007. Constructing a coherent joint prior while respecting biological realism: application to marine mammal stock assessments. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 1085–1100. Bayesian estimation methods, employing the Sampling–Importance–Resampling algorithm, are currently used to perform stock assessments for several stocks of marine mammals, including the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) off Greenland. However, owing to the functional relationships among parameters in deterministic age-structured population dynamics models, placing explicit priors on each life history parameter in addition to the population growth rate parameter results in an incoherent joint prior distribution (i.e. two different priors on the estimated parameters). One solution to constructing a coherent joint prior is to solve for juvenile survival analytically, using values generated from the prior distributions for the remaining parameters. However, certain combinations of model parameter values result in values for juvenile survival that are larger than adult survival, which is biologically implausible. Therefore, to respect biological realism, certain parameter values must be rejected for some or all the remaining parameters. This study investigates several alternative resampling schemes for obtaining a realistic joint prior distribution, given the constraint on survival rates. The sensitivity of assessment results is investigated for data-rich (bowhead) and data-poor (walrus) scenarios. The results based on limited data are especially sensitive to the choice of alternative resampling scheme.},

	abstract = {Estimating population trends for long-lived, migratory animals is challenging but essential for managing populations. Here we propose using a simple but potentially robust method, the direct estimation of population growth rate (PGR) from capture−recapture data. We considered an Endangered population of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae breeding and calving annually in the southern lagoon of New Caledonia. Studied since 1996, this population is known to exhibit a strong signal of transience, i.e. the presence of individuals that pass through the sampling area once, inducing detection heterogeneity. Another difficulty is that a more recently discovered second breeding and calving habitat (offshore seamounts to the south) has been surveyed with less intensity. Current direct PGR estimation models cannot deal with spatial sampling heterogeneity. In order to assess the reliability of the proposed method — in general and for our population in particular — we evaluated its robustness using simulations: first, when there are transient individuals; then, when the study area is split into 2 unequally sampled parts. We found no bias in PGR in the presence of transients. The bias with 2 unequally sampled parts depends on the amount and direction of exchanges, but appears negligible in our case study. The constant yearly PGR of the New Caledonian humpback whale population at the level of the 2 habitats was estimated at 1.15 (95\% CI 1.11−1.20), suggesting outside recruitment. Whenever capture−recapture is feasible, we recommend the Pradel approach to estimate the PGR, validated with appropriate simulations, in order to assess population welfare.},

	abstract = {Background:  Fine-scale data on animal position are increasingly enabling us to understand the details of animal movement ecology and dead-reckoning, a technique integrating motion sensor-derived information on heading and speed, can be used to reconstruct fine-scale movement paths at sub-second resolution, irrespective of the environ‑ment. On its own however, the dead-reckoning process is prone to cumulative errors, so that position estimates quickly become uncoupled from true location. Periodic ground-truthing with aligned location data (e.g., from global positioning technology) can correct for this drift between Verified Positions (VPs). We present step-by-step instruc‑tions for implementing Verified Position Correction (VPC) dead-reckoning in R using the tilt-compensated compass method, accompanied by the mathematical protocols underlying the code and improvements and extensions of this technique to reduce the trade-off between VPC rate and dead-reckoning accuracy. These protocols are all built into a user-friendly, fully annotated VPC dead-reckoning R function; Gundog.Tracks, with multi-functionality to reconstruct animal movement paths across terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial systems, provided within the Additional file 4 as well as online (GitHub).
Results: The Gundog.Tracks function is demonstrated on three contrasting model species (the African lion Panthera leo, the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, and the Imperial cormorant Leucocarbo atriceps) moving on land, in water and in air. We show the effect of uncorrected errors in speed estimations, heading inaccuracies and infrequent VPC rate and demonstrate how these issues can be addressed.
Conclusions:  The function provided will allow anyone familiar with R to dead-reckon animal tracks readily and accu‑rately, as the key complex issues are dealt with by Gundog.Tracks. This will help the community to consider and imple‑ment a valuable, but often overlooked method of reconstructing high-resolution animal movement paths across diverse species and systems without requiring a bespoke application.},

              The massively accelerated biodiversity loss rate in the Anthropocene calls for an efficient and effective way to identify the spatial and temporal dynamics of endangered species. To this end, we developed a useful identification framework based on a case study of locally endangered
              Sousa chinensis
              by combining both LEK (local ecological knowledge) evaluation and regional boat-based survey methods. Our study investigated the basic ecological information of
              Sousa chinensis
              in the estuaries of eastern Guangdong that had previously been neglected, which could guide the future study and conservation. Based on the statistical testing of reported spatial and temporal dolphins sighting data from fishermen and the ecological monitoring analyses, including sighting rate, site fidelity and residence time estimations, some of the current
              Sousa chinensis
              units are likely to be geographically isolated and critically endangered, which calls for much greater conservation efforts. Given the accelerated population extinction rate and increasing budgetary constraints, our survey pattern can be applied in a timely and economically acceptable manner to the spatial and temporal assessment of other threatened coastal delphinids, particularly when population distributions are on a large scale and traditional sampling methods are difficult to implement.},

Ferns comprise a major terrestrial plant radiation with an extensive evolutionary history providing a wealth of modern and fossil data for modelling environmental drivers of diversification. Here we develop a novel Bayesian model to simultaneously estimate correlations between diversification dynamics and multiple environmental trajectories. We estimate the impact of different factors on fern diversification over the past 400 million years by analysing a comprehensive dataset of fossil occurrences and complement these findings by analysing a large molecular phylogeny. We show that origination and extinction rates are governed by fundamentally different processes: originations depend on within-group diversity but are largely unaffected by environmental changes, whereas extinctions are strongly affected by external factors such as climate and geology. Our results indicate that the prime driver of fern diversity dynamics is environmentally driven extinction, with origination being an opportunistic response to diminishing ecospace occupancy.},

Sea level mirrors oxygen isotope variations, reflecting ice-volume change on the 104- to 106-year scale, but a link between oxygen isotope and sea level on the 107-year scale must be due to temperature changes that we attribute to tectonically controlled carbon dioxide variations. Sea-level change has influenced phytoplankton evolution, ocean chemistry, and the loci of carbonate, organic carbon, and siliciclastic sediment burial. Over the past 100 My, sea-level changes reflect global climate evolution from a time of ephemeral Antarctic ice sheets (100 to 33 Ma), through a time of large ice sheets primarily in Antarctica (33 to 2.5 Ma), to a world with large Antarctic and large, variable Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (2.5 Ma to the present).},

This paper evaluates four methods called shareholder quorum subsampling, true richness estimated using a Poisson sampling model (TRiPS), squares, and the corrected first-order jackknife (cJ1). Quorum subsampling interpolates to produce a relative richness estimate, while the other three extrapolate to the size of the overall species pool. Here I use routine ecological data to show that squares and cJ1 pass several basic validation tests, but TRiPS does not. First, TRiPS estimates are insensitive to the shape of abundance distributions, being entirely predicted by total counts of species and of individuals regardless of the details. Furthermore, TRiPS tends not to extrapolate at all when sampling is moderate or intense. Second, all three extrapolators yield lower values when they work with small uniform subsamples of large raw inventories. The third test is a split-analyze-and-sum analysis: each inventory is divided between the most common and least common halves of the abundance distribution, the methods are applied to the half-inventories, and the estimates are summed. Squares and cJ1 perform well here, but TRiPS does not extrapolate as long as the full inventories are reasonably well-sampled. It is otherwise not particularly accurate. The extrapolators are largely insensitive to the influence of abundance distribution evenness, as quantified using Pielou's J and a new index called the ratio of means. Quorum subsampling generally performs well, but it stumbles on the split-analyze-and-sum test and is confounded somewhat by evenness.},

Here, we consider the megaclimate regime2 at scales ≥1 million years (Myr). We focus on determining the domains of ‘wandering’ stochastic Earth system processes (‘Court Jester’3) and stabilizing biotic interactions that induce diversity dependence of fluctuations in macroevolutionary rates (‘Red Queen’4). Using state-of-the-art multiscale Haar and cross-Haar fluctuation analyses, we analysed the global genus-level Phanerozoic marine animal Paleobiology Database record of extinction rates (E), origination rates (O) and diversity (D) as well as sea water palaeotemperatures (T). Over the entire observed range from several million years to several hundred million years, we found that the fluctuations of T, E and O showed time-scaling behaviour. The megaclimate was characterized by positive scaling exponents—it is therefore apparently unstable. E and O are also scaling but with negative exponents—stable behaviour that is biotically mediated. For D, there were two regimes with a crossover at critical timescale \$\${\textbackslash}Delta \{t\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{trans\}\}\}\$\$ ≈ 40 Myr. For shorter timescales, D exhibited nearly the same positive scaling as the megaclimate palaeotemperatures, whereas for longer timescales it tracks the scaling of macroevolutionary rates. At scales of at least \$\${\textbackslash}Delta \{t\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{trans\}\}\}\$\$there is onset of diversity dependence of E and O, probably enabled by mixing and synchronization (globalization) of the biota by geodispersal (‘Geo-Red Queen’).},

	abstract = {Unbiased time series of diversity dynamics are vital for quantifying the grand history of life. Applications include identifying ancient mass extinctions and inferring both biotic and abiotic controls on diversification rates. We introduce divDyn, a new r package that facilitates the calculation of taxonomic richness, extinction and origination rates from time-binned fossil data. State-of-the-art counting protocols, and sampling standardization functions permit the reconstruction of biologically meaningful time series. Additional functions permit the partitioning of turnover rates by environmental affinity. Using divDyn, we display Phanerozoic-scale diversity dynamics of marine invertebrates. With the help of the core function and standard subsampling options, we revisit the hypothesis of declining taxonomic rates over time, mass extinctions and equilibrial diversity dynamics and assess their methodological dependency. Our results suggest that rates declined only over the early Phanerozoic, only three mass extinctions stand out clearly, and evidence of equilibrial dynamics is dependent on the used methods. The modular and fast implementation of published methods ensures traceability, reproducibility and comparability of future studies.},

	abstract = {Natural hazards like ﬂoods, cyclones, earthquakes, or, tsunamis have deep impacts on the environment and society causing damage to both life and property. These events can cause widespread destruction and can lead to long-term socio-economic disruption often affecting the most vulnerable populations in society. Computational modeling provides an essential tool to estimate the damage by incorporating spatial uncertainties and examining global risk assessments. Classical stationary models in spatial statistics often assume isotropy and stationarity. It causes inappropriate smoothing over features having boundaries, holes, or physical barriers. Despite this, nonstationary models like barrier model have been little explored in the context of natural disasters in complex land structures. The principal objective of the current study is to evaluate the inﬂuence of barrier models compared to classical stationary models by analysing the incidence of natural disasters in complex spatial regions like islands and coastal areas. In the current study, we have used tsunami records from the island nation of Maldives. For seven atoll groups considered in our study, we have implemented three distinct categories of stochastic partial differential equation meshes, two for stationary models and one that corresponds to the barrier model concept. The results show that when assessing the spatial variance of tsunami incidence at the atoll scale, the barrier model outperforms the other two models while maintaining the same computational cost as the stationary models. In the broader picture, this research work contributes to the relatively new ﬁeld of nonstationary barrier models and intends to establish a robust modeling framework to explore spatial phenomena, particularly natural hazards, in complex spatial regions having physical barriers.},

	abstract = {Desde que el cultivo a gran escala de salmón (Salmo salar) en mar abierto comenzó́ en Noruega en el último tercio del siglo pasado, los escapes siempre han supuesto uno de los mayores problemas, tanto para las empresas como para el ecosistema marino. Siendo, en todos los casos, las pérdidas por escapes uno de los principales desafíos en el proceso de producción. Desde un punto de vista medioambiental, una vez que los peces escapan de las jaulas se convierten en un elemento más del ecosistema marino, pudiendo interaccionar con otros peces y organismos presentes en el medio. Como consecuencia, algunos países productores que han apostado por la acuicultura como parte importante en su economía, han desarrollado marcos legales que regulan los escapes de peces. Estas normativas incluyen, además de medidas de prevención y de información obligatoria a la administración competente cuando se producen escapes, la necesidad de tener desarrollados planes de contingencia. España, pese a estar entre los primeros puestos a nivel de producción en la Unión Europea, todavía carece de herramientas legales que regulen los eventos de escapes, aunque su desarrollo está contemplado en el plan estratégico de la acuicultura española de los próximos años. El desarrollo de una herramienta legal que establezca cómo actuar en caso de escape y determine los derechos y obligaciones de los acuicultores ante un escape, es de vital importancia para gestionar los posibles efectos negativos a nivel socioeconómico, ecológico y sanitario. El objetivo de la presente publicación es promover la implementación de planes de contingencia y mitigación de escapes de peces, en base a la difusión del conocimiento existente para que puedan desarrollarse medidas legislativas que favorezcan la reducción de las pérdidas económicas y los perjuicios ambientales y sociales que se pudieran producir.},

	abstract = {During heavy storms in 1994–1995, salmon farms in southern Chile lost several million fish from the most commonly farmed species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). To determine the abundance and distribution of such exotic salmon populations in the wild and their effect on native organisms, we conducted experimental fishing, in six locations in the salmon farming regions (41°–46° S) in the inner seas of Chiloé (X Region) and Aysen (XI Region), between November 1995 and December 1996. At the same time, we collected information from salmon farms and insurance companies about escaped individuals. During the experimental fishing we captured 2602 coho salmon, 984 trout, and 271 Atlantic salmon. Captures of the three species declined through the duration of the study; thus in November 1996 we captured {\textless}10\% of initial catches. Population projections based on three possible mortality rates (0.4, 0.8, and 1.2) predicted the disappearance of salmon by year 2000, and the highest mortality rate was the best predictor of the observed available biomass in 1996. Thus, artisanal fishing may control escaped salmon. Of the three species, coho salmon had the best chances of becoming established in the remote XI Region where the artisanal fishing pressure was less intense. The three salmon species showed feeding similarities, since each kept feeding on pellets beneath the farms, particularly Atlantic salmon, while coho salmon showed greater preference for schooling fish, and rainbow trout fed more often on crustaceans. Thus, the three species, particularly coho salmon, could compete with native southern hake and mackerel. As a management approach to avoid salmon colonization and naturalization in southern Chile, local artisanal fishing should be encouraged because it is probably the most efficient way to remove escaped individuals and reduce the chance of populations becoming self-sustaining.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is vital in the functioning of ecosystems, but it’s permanently being threatened by anthropic impacts derived from productive activities. Thus, conservation has become a global challenge. In Chile, the dissociation between economic activities and conservation has triggered numerous socio-environmental conflicts in recent decades. This work explores how different projects that give rise to these conflicts can represent an underestimated threat to biodiversity. We identified socio-environmental conflicts in Chile and their associated projects by carrying out an online review of 1035 news articles published between 2004 and 2018 using the key words “environmental conflict”. We selected articles describing a socio-environmental conflict between parties caused by a project or productive sector. Conflict-generating projects were classified by productive sector and capital origin. In addition, their geographical distribution with respect to High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs, protected areas and priority sites for conservation) was determined. A total of 283 projects were identified from 14 different productive sectors, most of them related to energy and mining, which threaten biodiversity and human well-being mainly due to pollution and habitat destruction. Chilean companies finance most of the projects, but international companies finance over half of the energy and mining projects. Moreover, 37 \% of the projects were located within HCVAs either for the establishment of future protected areas or where protected areas are currently established. As countries make new efforts to maintain and recover biodiversity, it is contradictory not to consider the threats posed by conflict-generating projects to key areas for conservation, both in public policies and in spatial planning instruments.},

Within the last decade, however, expert opinions have become an increasingly popular alternative for gaining complementary information to literature reviews. This study employed a standardized method for collecting bibliographic data combined with synthesize expert opinions to establish a current knowledge baseline on threats to Mediterranean freshwater ecosystems in Chile. We revised 79 scientific articles that included a variety of taxonomic groups containing fish (n = 32); macroinvertebrates (n = 17); amphibians (n = 18); freshwater plants (n = 8); and two taxonomic groups simultaneously (n = 4). From this review, we identified 14 threats, with land-use change, species introductions, and industrial/domestic effluents as salient factors. These findings were in agreement with results from expert opinion surveys (n = 46 researchers). An analysis by taxonomic group indicated freshwater fishes as most threatened by hydropower plants. Aquatic plants were most threatened by mining. Amphibians were most threatened by changes in soil use whereas aquatic macroinvertebrates by industrial/domestic effluents. Remarkably, the magnitude of threats identified in the literature review was of similar order than those catalogued by experts. Moreover, the primary threats identified here align with those reported in other Mediterranean regions of the world. Our combined approach using literature review and expert opinion was useful in determining the consistency of the main threats to each taxonomic group. Our findings can be used as a baseline to further research and in prioritizing management strategies for threatened Mediterranean ecosystems worldwide.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that affects one in 45 children in the United States, with a similarly striking prevalence in countries around the world. However, mechanisms underlying its etiology and manifestations remain poorly understood. Although ASD is diagnosed based on the presence and severity of impaired social communication and repetitive behavior, immune dysregulation and gastrointestinal issues are common comorbidities. The microbiome is an integral part of human physiology; recent studies show that changes in the gut microbiota can modulate gastrointestinal physiology, immune function, and even behavior. Links between particular bacteria from the indigenous gut microbiota and phenotypes relevant to ASD raise the important question of whether microbial dysbiosis plays a role in the development or presentation of ASD symptoms. Here we review reports of microbial dysbiosis in ASD. We further discuss potential effects of the microbiota on ASD-associated symptoms, drawing on signaling mechanisms for reciprocal interactions among the microbiota, immunity, gut function, and behavior. In addition, we discuss recent findings supporting a role for the microbiome as an interface between environmental and genetic risk factors that are associated with ASD. These studies highlight the integration of pathways across multiple body systems that together can impact brain and behavior and suggest that changes in the microbiome may contribute to symptoms of neurodevelopmental disease.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severely neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs a child's ability to communicate and interact with others. Children with neurodevelopmental disorder, including ASD, are regularly affected by gastrointestinal problems and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. On the other hand, humans live in a co-evolutionary association with plenty of microorganisms that resident on the exposed and internal surfaces of our bodies. The microbiome, refers to the collection of microbes and their genetic material, confers a variety of physiologic benefits to the host in many key aspects of life as well as being responsible for some diseases. A large body of preclinical literature indicates that gut microbiome plays an important role in the bidirectional gut-brain axis that communicates between the gut and central nervous system. Moreover, accumulating evidences suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the pathogenesis of ASD. The present review introduces the increasing evidence suggesting the reciprocal interaction network among microbiome, gut and brain. It also discusses the possible mechanisms by which gut microbiome influences the etiology of ASD via altering gut-brain axis. Most importantly, it highlights the new findings of targeting gut microbiome, including probiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplant, as novel and potential therapeutics for ASD diseases.},

	abstract = {High-throughput post-genomic studies are now routinely and promisingly investigated in biological and biomedical research. The main statistical approach to select genes differentially expressed between two groups is to apply a t-test, which is subject of criticism in the literature. Numerous alternatives have been developed based on different and innovative variance modeling strategies. However, a critical issue is that selecting a different test usually leads to a different gene list. In this context and given the current tendency to apply the t-test, identifying the most efficient approach in practice remains crucial. To provide elements to answer, we conduct a comparison of eight tests representative of variance modeling strategies in gene expression data: Welch's t-test, ANOVA [1], Wilcoxon's test, SAM [2], RVM [3], limma [4], VarMixt [5] and SMVar [6]. Our comparison process relies on four steps (gene list analysis, simulations, spike-in data and re-sampling) to formulate comprehensive and robust conclusions about test performance, in terms of statistical power, false-positive rate, execution time and ease of use. Our results raise concerns about the ability of some methods to control the expected number of false positives at a desirable level. Besides, two tests (limma and VarMixt) show significant improvement compared to the t-test, in particular to deal with small sample sizes. In addition limma presents several practical advantages, so we advocate its application to analyze gene expression data.},

	abstract = {Background The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

	abstract = {The microbiome regulates endocrine systems and influences many aspects of hormone signaling. Using examples from different animal taxa, we highlight the state of the science in microbiome research as it relates to endocrinology and endocrine disruption research. Using a comparative approach discussing fish, birds, and mammals, we demonstrate the bidirectional interaction between microbiota and hormone systems, presenting concepts that include (1) gastrointestinal microbiome regulation of the neuroendocrine feeding axis; (2) stress hormones and microbial communities; (3) the role of site-specific microbiota in animal reproduction; (4) microbiome effects on the neuroendocrine systems and behavior; and (5) novel mechanisms of endocrine disruption through the microbiome. This mini-review demonstrates that hormones can directly affect the richness and diversity of microbiota and conversely, microbiota can influence hormone production and mediate their functions in animals. In addition, microbiota can influence the action of a diverse range of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the central nervous system, which can lead to behavioral disruptions. As many animals have species-specific reproductive behaviors, it is important to understand how shifts in the microbiota relate to these complex interactions between sexes. This is especially important for captive animals on specialized diets, and there are significant implications for microbiome research in conservation and reproductive biology. For example, microbial metabolites may modify motility of gametes or modulate hormone-receptor interactions in reproductive tissues. Thus, efforts to incorporate metabolomics into the science of microbiome-endocrine relationships, both those produced by the host and those generated from microbial metabolism, are increasingly needed. These concepts have fostered an exciting emerging era in comparative endocrinology.},

We performed a large autism stool metagenomics study (n = 247) based on participants from the Australian Autism Biobank and the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain project. We found negligible direct associations between ASD diagnosis and the gut microbiome. Instead, our data support a model whereby ASD-related restricted interests are associated with less-diverse diet, and in turn reduced microbial taxonomic diversity and looser stool consistency. In contrast to ASD diagnosis, our dataset was well powered to detect microbiome associations with traits such as age, dietary intake, and stool consistency. Overall, microbiome differences in ASD may reflect dietary preferences that relate to diagnostic features, and we caution against claims that the microbiome has a driving role in ASD.},

	abstract = {Background: The accuracy of microbial community detection in 16S rRNA marker-gene and metagenomic studies suffers from contamination and sequencing errors that lead to either falsely identifying microbial taxa that were not in the sample or misclassifying the taxa of DNA fragment reads. Removing contaminants and filtering rare features are two common approaches to deal with this problem. While contaminant detection methods use auxiliary sequencing process information to identify known contaminants, filtering methods remove taxa that are present in a small number of samples and have small counts in the samples where they are observed. The latter approach reduces the extreme sparsity of microbiome data and has been shown to correctly remove contaminant taxa in cultured “mock” datasets, where the true taxa compositions are known. Although filtering is frequently used, careful evaluation of its effect on the data analysis and scientific conclusions remains unreported. Here, we assess the effect of filtering on the alpha and beta diversity estimation as well as its impact on identifying taxa that discriminate between disease states.Results: The effect of filtering on microbiome data analysis is illustrated on four datasets: two mock quality control datasets where the same cultured samples with known microbial composition are processed at different labs and two disease study datasets. Results show that in microbiome quality control datasets, filtering reduces the magnitude of differences in alpha diversity and alleviates technical variability between labs while preserving the between samples similarity (beta diversity). In the disease study datasets, DESeq2 and linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) methods were used to identify taxa that are differentially abundant across groups of samples, and random forest models were used to rank features with the largest contribution toward disease classification. Results reveal that filtering retains significant taxa and preserves the model classification ability measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The comparison between the filtering and the contaminant removal method shows that they have complementary effects and are advised to be used in conjunction.Conclusions: Filtering reduces the complexity of microbiome data while preserving their integrity in downstream analysis. This leads to mitigation of the classification methods' sensitivity and reduction of technical variability, allowing researchers to generate more reproducible and comparable results in microbiome data analysis.},

Particularly, 16S rRNA gene sequences have been frequently used to profile the diversity of organisms in a sample. However, such studies are still taxed to determine both the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their relative abundance in a sample.Results: To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian clustering method termed Clustering 16S rRNA for OTU Prediction (CROP). CROP can find clusters based on the natural organization of data without setting a hard cut-off threshold (3\%/5\%) as required by hierarchical clustering methods. By applying our method to several datasets, we demonstrate that CROP is robust against sequencing errors and that it produces more accurate results than conventional hierarchical clustering methods.Availability and Implementation: Source code freely available at the following URL: http://code.google.com/p/crop-tingchenlab/, implemented in C++ and supported on Linux and MS Windows.Contact:tingchen@usc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of 16S rRNA sequences through next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the microbial community composition and structure. One common approach in using these data to explore the genetic diversity in a microbial community is to cluster the 16S rRNA sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on sequence similarities. The inferred OTUs can then be used to estimate species, diversity, composition, and richness. Although a number of methods have been developed and commonly used to cluster the sequences into OTUs, relatively little guidance is available on their relative performance and the choice of key parameters for each method. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten existing OTU inference methods. We found that the appropriate dissimilarity value for defining distinct OTUs is not only related with a specific method but also related with the sample complexity. For data sets with low complexity, all the algorithms need a higher dissimilarity threshold to define OTUs. Some methods, such as, CROP and SLP, are more robust to the specific choice of the threshold than other methods, especially for shorter reads. For high-complexity data sets, hierarchical cluster methods need a more strict dissimilarity threshold to define OTUs because the commonly used dissimilarity threshold of 3\% often leads to an under-estimation of the number of OTUs. In general, hierarchical clustering methods perform better at lower dissimilarity thresholds. Our results show that sequence abundance plays an important role in OTU inference. We conclude that care is needed to choose both a threshold for dissimilarity and abundance for OTU inference.},

	abstract = {Although we can't usually see them, microbes are essential for every part of human life-indeed all life on Earth. The emerging field of metagenomics offers a new way of exploring the microbial world that will transform modern microbiology and lead to practical applications in medicine, agriculture, alternative energy, environmental remediation, and many others areas. Metagenomics allows researchers to look at the genomes of all of the microbes in an environment at once, providing a "meta" view of the whole microbial community and the complex interactions within it. It's a quantum leap beyond traditional research techniques that rely on studying-one at a time-the few microbes that can be grown in the laboratory. At the request of the National Science Foundation, five Institutes of the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy, the National Research Council organized a committee to address the current state of metagenomics and identify obstacles current researchers are facing in order to determine how to best support the field and encourage its success. The New Science of Metagenomics recommends the establishment of a "Global Metagenomics Initiative" comprising a small number of large-scale metagenomics projects as well as many medium- and small-scale projects to advance the technology and develop the standard practices needed to advance the field. The report also addresses database needs, methodological challenges, and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in supporting this new field.},

The body sites with the greatest number of core OTUs, defined as OTUs shared amongst 95\% or more of the individuals, were the oral sites (saliva, tongue, cheek, gums, and throat) followed by the nose, stool, and skin, while the vaginal sites had the fewest number of OTUs shared across subjects. We found that commonalities between samples based on taxonomy could sometimes belie variability at the sub-genus OTU level. This was particularly apparent in the mouth where a given genus can be present in many different oral sites, but the sub-genus OTUs show very distinct site selection, and in the vaginal sites, which are consistently dominated by the Lactobacillus genus but have distinctly different sub-genus V1–V3 OTU populations across subjects. Different body sites show approximately a ten-fold difference in estimated microbial richness, with stool samples having the highest estimated richness, followed by the mouth, throat and gums, then by the skin, nasal and vaginal sites. Richness as measured by the V1–V3 primers was consistently higher than richness measured by V3–V5. We also show that when such a large cohort is analyzed at the genus level, most subjects fit the stool “enterotype” profile, but other subjects are intermediate, blurring the distinction between the enterotypes. When analyzed at the finer-scale, OTU level, there was little or no segregation into stool enterotypes, but in the vagina distinct biotypes were apparent. Finally, we note that even OTUs present in nearly every subject, or that dominate in some samples, showed orders of magnitude variation in relative abundance emphasizing the highly variable nature across individuals.},

However, high-throughput sequencing of the full gene has only recently become a realistic prospect. Here, we use in silico and sequence-based experiments to critically re-evaluate the potential of the 16S gene to provide taxonomic resolution at species and strain level. We demonstrate that targeting of 16S variable regions with short-read sequencing platforms cannot achieve the taxonomic resolution afforded by sequencing the entire ({\textasciitilde}1500 bp) gene. We further demonstrate that full-length sequencing platforms are sufficiently accurate to resolve subtle nucleotide substitutions (but not insertions/deletions) that exist between intragenomic copies of the 16S gene. In consequence, we argue that modern analysis approaches must necessarily account for intragenomic variation between 16S gene copies. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate treatment of full-length 16S intragenomic copy variants has the potential to provide taxonomic resolution of bacterial communities at species and strain level.},

	abstract = {Despite the availability of abundant literature on green tea, studies on the use of L-theanine (an amino acid found only in green tea) as a feed additive in poultry especially broiler are limited. So, this study was conducted to explore the effects of L-theanine on the intestinal microbiome and immune response in a broiler. A total of 400-d-old chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) using a complete randomized design. Treatments were as follows: A, control (basal diet); B, basal diet + 100 mg L-theanine/kg diet; C, basal diet + 200 mg L-theanine/kg diet; and D, basal diet + 300 mg L-theanine/kg diet. Mucosal samples from ileum and jejunum of broiler chicken were extracted at 21 and 42 d of age. Extraction of genomic DNA was followed by amplification of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA. After Illumina sequencing, results revealed that treatment with L-theanine significantly increased the population of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum as compared to a control group, but the higher population was observed in jejunum at both 21 and 42 d of age. The overall diversity of the jejunum microbiome in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the ileum and control group (P {\textless} 0.05). Results of this study revealed that mRNA expression of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) was decreased in response to treatment with L-theanine. Moreover, the negative correlation of abundance of Lactobacillus was observed with expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the intestine and these effects were highly significant (P {\textless} 0.01). In summary, our finding revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine exhibited a positive influence on intestinal bacteria by supporting beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus while decreasing harmful microbes like Clostridium.},

The purpose of this review is to analyze the basis of this assumption by examining the comparative studies between Asperger’s disorder (AsD) and autistic disorder (AD), and between pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise speciﬁed (PDDNOS) and AD. In all, 125 studies compared AsD with AD. Of these, 30 studies concluded that AsD and AD were similar conditions while 95 studies found quantitative and qualitative differences between them. Likewise, 37 studies compared PDDNOS with AD. Nine of these concluded that PDDNOS did not differ signiﬁcantly from AD while 28 reported quantitative and qualitative differences between them. Taken together, these ﬁndings do not support the conceptualization of AD, AsD and PDDNOS as a single category of ASD. Irrespective of the changes proposed by the DSM-5, future research and clinical practice will continue to ﬁnd ways to meaningfully subtype the ASD.},

	abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

The mean 24 h milk sodium concentrations (x̄Na) decreased between 3.5 and 18 wk postpartum (p \&lt; 0.005 by paired t test). Changes in mean potassium (x̄K) were not statistically significant. Diet apparently does not affect milk Na. Administration of a low Na diet: 10.8 ± .9 (SD) mEq Na/day and 60 to 100 mEq K/day for 2 days did not change x̄Na. But urinary Na decreased 7-fold as aldosterone increased 5-fold. No significant correlation was seen between 24 h Na excretion in urine and x̄Na in milk (n = 51).

	abstract = {Renal function including fluid and electrolyte balance was studied during recovery in eight subjects who developed symptomatic hyponatremia (HN; plasma sodium concentration less than 130 mM) during an 88-km ultramarathon footrace and compared with results for normonatremic runners [NN; n = 18, mean postrace plasma sodium concentration, 138.2 +/- 1.2 (SE) mM]. Estimated fluid intake during the race for HN was 12.5 +/- 1.6 (SE) liters over 9 h 41 min (+/- 28 min). HN excreted a net fluid excess of 2.95 +/- 0.56 (range 1.2–5.9) liters compared with a fluid deficit of 2.7 +/- 0.3\% body weight in NN. The sodium deficit was 153 +/- 35 mmol in HN and 187 +/- 37 mmol in NN. Despite the fluid overload, plasma volume was decreased by 24.1 +/- 5.0\% in HN compared with 8.2 +/- 2.6\% in NN. Serum renin activity (5.1 +/- 2.0 ng.ml-1.h-1), aldosterone concentrations (410 +/- 34 ng/l), creatinine clearances (174.8 +/- 28.2 ml/min), and urine output (6.4 +/- 1.0 ml/min) were markedly elevated in HN during recovery. Thus the hyponatremia of exercise results from fluid retention in subjects who ingest abnormally large fluid volumes during prolonged exercise.},

	abstract = {Taurine content is high (mM) in mammalian brain. By its major role as an osmolyte, taurine contributes to the cell volume control, which is particularly critical in the brain. Taurine participates in osmotic adjustments required to maintain the organization and size of intracellular compartments. It counteracts volume fluctuations in unbalanced transmembrane fluxes of ions and neurotransmitters, preserving the functional synaptic contacts. Taurine has a key role in the long-term adaptation to chronic hyponatremia as well as in other pathologies leading to brain edema. Together with other osmolytes, taurine corrects cell shrinkage, preventing mysfunction of organelles and apoptosis. Swelling corrective taurine efflux occurs through a leak pathway, likely formed by LCRR8 protein isoforms. Shrinkage-activated influx comes largely by the increased activity of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter. The brain taurine pool results from the equilibrium between (i) dietary intake and active transport into the cell, (ii) synthesis in the brain itself or import of that synthesized elsewhere, and (iii) leak and posterior excretion. The interplay between these elements preserves brain taurine homeostasis in physiological conditions and permits the proper adjustments upon deviations of normal in the internal/external environment.},

	abstract = {Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.},

	abstract = {Cerebral edema due to exercise-associated hyponatremia and cardiac arrest due to atherosclerotic heart disease cause rare marathonrelated fatalities in young female and middle-aged male runners, respectively. Studies in asymptomatic middle-aged male runners during races identified inflammation due to skeletal muscle injury after glycogen depletion as the shared underlying cause. Nonosmotic secretion of arginine vasopressin as a neuroendocrine stress response to rhabdomyolysis mediates hyponatremia as a variant of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Fatal hyponatremic encephalopathy in young female runners was curtailed using emergent infusion of intravenous hypertonic (3\%) saline to reverse cerebral edema based on this paradigm, which treatment was arrived at through a consensus process within the medical community. An increasing frequency of cardiac arrest and sudden death has been identified in middle-aged male runners in two studies since the year 2000. Same-aged asymptomatic male physician-runners showed post-race elevations in interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, which biomarkers predict acute cardiac events in healthy persons. Hypercoagulability with in vivo platelet activation and release of cardiac troponin and NT-pro-B-natriuretic peptide were also observed post-race in these same subjects. High short-term risk for atherothrombosis during races as shown by stratification of biomarkers in asymptomatic males may render non-obstructive coronary atherosclerotic plaques vulnerable to rupture. Pre-race aspirin usage in this high-risk subgroup is prudent based on conclusive evidence for preventing first acute myocardial infarctions in same-aged healthy male physicians. Based on validated clinical paradigms, taking a low-dose aspirin before a marathon and drinking to thirst during the race may avert preventable deaths in susceptible runners.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

	abstract = {Objective: Hyperhydration and exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) are critical issues during endurance events. We studied a cohort of marathon runners to examine EAH’s prevalence in a marathon with a short time limit and to investigate underlying mechanisms that may be responsible for its development. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: 2006 Zurich Marathon (cool and rainy weather, time limit of 5 hours). Participants: 167 marathon runners were recruited the month before the race. Main Outcome Measures: Body mass, plasma sodium, and osmolality were measured just before the start and immediately after the race. Fluid intake during the race was ascertained by a recall questionnaire.
Results: Five subjects (3 \%) developed asymptomatic EAH, and no symptomatic EAH was found. Body mass change during the race correlated similarly with postrace sodium levels (r = 20.72, P , 0.0001) and with sodium change during the race (r = 20.66, P , 0.0001). Postrace sodium levels correlated signiﬁcantly with sodium change during the race (r = 0.74, P , 0.0001). Fluid intake correlated signiﬁcantly (r = 20.43, P , 0.0001) with plasma sodium change between the start and ﬁnish of the race. Postrace sodium levels and postrace osmolality were signiﬁcantly correlated (r = 0.68, P , 0.0001).
Conclusion: In this study we observed a relatively low incidence of EAH in subjects running the marathon in around 2.5 to 5 hours and in a cool environment. Plasma sodium change during the race and postrace sodium levels correlated with body mass change. There was also a direct correlation between ﬂuid intake and plasma sodium change during the race.},

Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

In this paper, we review the features of the R package survHE, speciﬁcally designed to wrap several tools to perform survival analysis for economic evaluation. In particular, survHE embeds both a standard, frequentist analysis (through the R package ﬂexsurv) and a Bayesian approach, based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (via the R package rstan) or integrated nested Laplace approximation (with the R package INLA). Using this composite approach, we obtain maximum ﬂexibility and are able to pre-compile a wide range of parametric models, with a view of simplifying the modelers’ work and allowing them to move away from non-optimal work ﬂows, including spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel).},

	abstract = {Background: Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is often associated with increased intracranial pressure and can be the initial manifestation of hyponatremic encephalopathy. Marathon runners tend to develop conditions that lead to hyponatremia. In a recent prospective study, 18\% of 605 marathon runners developed hyponatremia; women with hyponatremia had lower plasma sodium levels and were more symptomatic than men (1). Hyponatremia in these patients resulted from substantial retention of ingested water (1). We recently reported that patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy can present with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (2). In the present report, we describe seven marathon runners who presented with hyponatremic encephalopathy and pulmonary edema.
Objective: To describe the development and treatment of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in marathon runners that was associated with hyponatremic encephalopathy. Case Findings Design: Case series. Setting: One university hospital and two community hospitals. Patients: Seven healthy marathon runners who had a history of nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug use. The runners collapsed after competing in a marathon and were hospitalized with pulmonary edema.
Measurements: Plasma sodium levels, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, cardiac enzyme levels, and magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans of the brain.
Results: Patients had nausea, emesis, and obtundation. The mean (ϮSD) plasma sodium level was 121 Ϯ 3 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation was less than 70\%. Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were normal. Chest radiographs showed pulmonary edema with a normal heart. Creatine phosphokinase–MB bands, troponin levels, and pulmonary wedge pressure were not elevated. Scanning of the brain showed cerebral edema. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Treatment with intravenous NaCl, 514 mmol/L, increased plasma sodium levels by 10 mmol/L in 12 hours. Pulmonary and cerebral edema resolved as the sodium level increased. One patient had unsuspected hyponatremic encephalopathy and died of cardiopulmonary arrest caused by brainstem herniation. All six treated patients recovered and were well after 1 year of follow-up.
Conclusions: In healthy marathon runners, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can be associated with hyponatremic encephalopathy. The condition may be fatal if undiagnosed and can be successfully treated with hypertonic NaCl.},

This review emphasizes the value of identifying current nutritional approaches specific to individuals with ASD and integrating their effects on symptoms to the conversation and presents suggestions for future research designed to identify medical nutrition therapies targeting this population to better understand the link between ASD and nutrition.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by deficits in the ability to socialise, communicate and use imagination, and displays of stereotypical behaviour. It is widely accepted that ASD involves a disorder in brain development. However, the real causes of the neurodevelopmental disorders associated with ASD are not clear. In this respect, it has been found that a majority of children with ASD display gastrointestinal symptoms, and an increased intestinal permeability. Moreover, large differences in microbiotic composition between ASD patients and controls have been reported. Therefore, nutrition-related factors have been hypothesised to play a causal role in the aetiology of ASD and its symptoms. Through a review of the literature, it was found that abnormalities in carbohydrate digestion and absorption could explain some of the gastrointestinal problems observed in a subset of ASD patients, although their role in the neurological and behavioural problems remains uncertain. In addition, the relationship between an improved gut health and a reduction of symptoms in some patients was evaluated. Recent trials involving gluten-free diets, casein-free diets, and pre- and probiotic, and multivitamin supplementation show contradictive but promising results. It can be concluded that nutrition and other environmental influences might trigger an unstable base of genetic predisposition, which may lead to the development of autism, at least in a subset of ASD patients. Clear directions for further research to improve diagnosis and treatment for the different subsets of the disorder are provided.},

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. To enhance the understanding of the gut microbiota structure in ASD children at different ages as well as the relationship between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, we first used the 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate the gut microbial population in a cohort of 143 children aged 2–13 years old. We found that the α-diversity of ASD group showed no significant change with age, while the TD group showed increased α-diversity with age, which indicates that the compositional development of the gut microbiota in ASD varies at different ages in ways that are not consistent with TD group. Recent studies have shown that chronic constipation is one of the most commonly obvious gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms along with ASD core symptoms. To further investigate the potential interaction effects between ASD and GI symptoms, the 30 C-ASD and their aged-matched TD were picked out to perform metagenomics analysis. We observed that C-ASD group displayed decreased diversity, depletion of species of Sutterella, Prevotella, and Bacteroides as well as dysregulation of associated metabolism activities, which may involve in the pathogenesis of C-ASD. Consistent with metagenomic analysis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) revealed some of the differential metabolites between C-ASD and TD group were involved in the metabolic network of neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, histidine, and GABA. Furthermore, we found these differences in metabolites were associated with altered abundance of specific bacteria. The study suggested possible future modalities for ASD intervention through targeting the specific bacteria associated with neurotransmitter metabolism.},

For marine conservation, global marine protected area (MPA) coverage is still falling short of the 10\% target set in 2010. Here we show that while this reflects a lack of progress in many low- and middle-income countries, a few of these nations have met or exceeded international commitments. To provide an in-depth explanation of how this was achieved in Gabon, we summarize the lessons learnt by our consortium of policy makers and practitioners who helped implement a comprehensive and ecologically representative network of 20 MPAs. We show the importance of creating a national framework, building long-term stakeholder support, and focusing on research that guides implementation and policy; and outline a four-step approach that countries and donors could use as an example to help meet international commitments. By responding to calls to share lessons learned to inform future Convention on Biological Diversity targets, we show how Gabon’s experiences could inform change elsewhere.},

While knowledge on the responses to offshore wind farms and associated shipping traffic is accumulating now at a fast pace, it becomes important to assess the population impacts on species affected by those activities. In the North Sea, the protected diver species Red-throated Diver (
              Gavia stellata
              ) and Black-throated Diver (
              Gavia arctica
              ) widely avoid offshore wind farms. We used an explicit spatio-temporal Bayesian model to get a robust estimate of the diver population during the spring season between 2001 and 2018, based on a set of aerial surveys from long-term monitoring programs within the German North Sea. Despite the erection of 20 offshore wind farms in the study area and marked responses of divers to wind farms, model results indicated that there was no population decline, and overall numbers fluctuated around 16,600 individuals, with average annual 95\% CI ranging between 13,400 and 21,360 individuals. Although, avoidance behavior due to wind farm development led to a more narrowly focused spatial distribution of the birds centered in the persistent high concentration zone in the Eastern German Bight Special Protection Area, the results provide no indication of negative fitness consequences on these long-lived species. However, more research is needed on habitat use and food availability in this regard.},

The presence/absence of the species is modelled with a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model using the geographical and environmental characteristics of each ﬁshing location. Maps of predicted probabilities of presence are generated using Bayesian kriging. Bayesian inference on the parameters and prediction of presence/absence in new locations (Bayesian kriging) are made by considering the model as a latent Gaussian model, which allows the use of the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) software (which has been seen to be quite a bit faster than the well-known MCMC methods). In particular, the spatial effect has been implemented with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach. The methodology is evaluated on Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) in the Western Mediterranean. The analysis shows that environmental and geographical factors can play an important role in directing local distribution and variability in the occurrence of species. Although this approach is used to recognize the habitat of mackerel, it could also be for other different species and life stages in order to improve knowledge of ﬁsh populations and communities.},

In the Mediterranean Sea there is increasing concern over elasmobranch species because their biological (ecological) characteristics make them highly vulnerable to ﬁshing pressure. Their removal could affect the structure and function of marine ecosystems, inducing changes in trophic interactions at the community level due to the selective elimination of predators or prey species, competitors and species replacement. In this study Bayesian hierarchical spatial models are used to map the sensitive habitats of the three most caught elasmobranch species (Galeus melastomus, Scyliorhinus canicula, Etmopterus spinax) in the western Mediterranean Sea, based on ﬁshery-dependent bottom trawl data. Results show that habitats associated with hard substrata and sandy beds, mainly in deep waters and with a high seabed gradient, have a greater probability registering the presence of the studied species than those associated with muddy shallow waters. Temperature and chlorophyll-α concentration show a negative relationship with S. canicula occurrence. Our results identify some of the sensitive habitats for elasmobranchs in the western Mediterranean Sea (GSA06 South), providing essential and easy-to-use interpretation tools, such as predictive distribution maps, with the ﬁnal aim of improving management and conservation of these vulnerable species.},

Several studies have compared the performance of some of these techniques, offering relevant information on their use. These studies, however, have been mainly focused on terrestrial species, while marine ones have been less studied and fishery-dependent data from commercial fleet have been scarcely used. Here, we evaluate three different techniques of SDMs, such as hierarchical Bayesian spatial models, classification trees globally optimized with evolutionary algorithms and random forests, dealing with fishery-dependent data of two elasmobranch species. Most of the elasmobranchs are vulnerable species, more likely to be affected by intense fishing activity than most teleosts and for these reasons are considered a priority in fishery research and management. We discuss difference in the implemented approaches and the possible implication for the fishery management.},

	abstract = {The current European Union has been progressively implementing since January 2014 a discard ban which includes the obligation to land unwanted catch for certain regulated species and sizes. Although a full enforcement of the landing obligation has a direct impact on discard reduction through more responsible and selective fishing, fishers argue that it will prompt both a decrease in incomes and an increase in working time onboard. Thus, the measure is in a hold in south-western waters due to the difficulties to implement the ban in mixed fisheries This paper analyzes some possible scenarios which fishers could face under the landing obli­ gation. It is shown the construction of a spatial bio-economic model to infer average costs, incomes and gross profits by fishing ground. We illustrate its use using a coastal trawling fleet based in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula as case study. Results show how fishing ground selection will remain the key factor affecting gross profits, well above the selection of closer fishing grounds, the improvement of fuel efficiency, or extending the length of the fishing trip. Increasing the number of crew members to overcome the expected excess of work time onboard would also be a cost-benefit balanced measure. According to our scenario simulations, to maintain business-as-usual (status quo situation) is the most probable fishing strategy without any regulation change. Fishing strategies are tight and maximized to current economic outcomes. Fishers will be reluctant to change their own fishing unless they are forced to for economic and/or regulatory reasons.},

	abstract = {Wildfires play an important role in shaping landscapes and as a source of CO2 and particulate matter, and are a typical spatial point process studied in many papers. Modeling the spatial variability of a wildfire could be performed in different ways and an important issue is the computational facilities that the new techniques afford us. The most common approaches have been through point pattern analysis or by Markov random fields. These methods have made it possible to build risk maps, but for many forest managers it is very useful to know the size of the fire as well as its location. In this work, we use Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) with Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to model the size of the forest fires observed in the Valencian Community, Spain. But the most important element in this paper is the process that needs to be carried out prior to simulating and analyzing the different point patterns, namely, the choice of the most suitable mesh for the database. We describe and take advantage of the Bayesian methodology by including INLA and SPDE in the modeling process in all the scenarios.},

We show that for sufficiently smooth Gaussian random field prior distributions, the approximation can converge with arbitrarily high order, whereas an approximation based on a counting process on a partition of the domain achieves only first-order convergence. The results improve upon the general theory of convergence for stochastic partial differential equation models introduced by Lindgren et al. (2011). The new method is demonstrated on a standard point pattern dataset, and two interesting extensions to the classical log-Gaussian Cox process framework are discussed. The first extension considers variable sampling effort throughout the observation window and implements the method of Chakraborty et al. (2011). The second extension constructs a log-Gaussian Cox process on the world's oceans. The analysis is performed using integrated nested Laplace approximation for fast approximate inference.},

	abstract = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in ℝ2 only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Matérn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of ℝd, between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

As part of traffic safety management strategies, efforts have focused on developing more accurate crash-frequency models and on identifying contributing factors in order to implement better countermeasures to improve traffic safety. Over time, models have increased in complexity and computational time. Bayesian models using the MCMC method have been commonly used in traffic safety analyses because of their ability to deal with complex models. Recently, the INLA approach has appeared as an alternative to the MCMC method by significantly reducing the computing time. In this study, an INLA-CAR model is developed to assess crashes by severity at the segment level on a highway section in Banda Aceh, Indonesia and is compared with a Bayesian non-spatial model. Results of the DIC show the importance of including spatial correlation in the models. The coefficient estimates show that AADT is the most influential in both models and across all severity types; however, the coefficient estimates for land use and horizontal alignment vary across severity types. Finally, in order to assess some limitations of the DIC, three other goodness-of-fit measures are used to cross-validate the results of the DIC.},

We extend the recent penalized complexity prior framework and develop a principled joint prior for the range and the marginal variance of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional Matérn GRFs with fixed smoothness. The prior is weakly informative and penalizes complexity by shrinking the range toward infinity and the marginal variance toward zero. We propose guidelines for selecting the hyperparameters, and a simulation study shows that the new prior provides a principled alternative to reference priors that can leverage prior knowledge to achieve shorter credible intervals while maintaining good coverage. We extend the prior to a nonstationary GRF parameterized through local ranges and marginal standard deviations, and introduce a scheme for selecting the hyperparameters based on the coverage of the parameters when fitting simulated stationary data. The approach is applied to a dataset of annual precipitation in southern Norway and the scheme for selecting the hyperparameters leads to conservative estimates of nonstationarity and improved predictive performance over the stationary model.

	abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

Predicting the wider ecological consequences of these declines requires understanding how predators influence communities by inflicting mortality on prey and inducing behavioral modifications (risk effects). Both mechanisms are important in marine communities, and a sole focus on the effects of predator-inflicted mortality might severely underestimate the importance of predators. We outline direct and indirect consequences of marine predator declines and propose an integrated predictive framework that includes risk effects, which appear to be strongest for long-lived prey species and when resources are abundant. We conclude that marine predators should be managed for the maintenance of both density- and risk-driven ecological processes, and not demographic persistence alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This is inadequate because these realms often interact through processes that form, utilize and maintain interfaces or connections, which are essential for the persistence of some species and ecosystem functions. We present a conceptual framework for systematic conservation prioritization that explicitly accounts for the connectivity between the terrestrial, marine, and freshwater realms. We propose a classification of this connectivity that encompasses: (1) narrow interfaces, such as riparian strips; (2) broad interfaces, such as estuaries; (3) constrained connections, such as corridors of native vegetation used by amphibians to move between natal ponds and adult habitat; and (4) diffuse connections, such as the movements of animals between breeding and feeding habitats. We use this taxonomy of inter-realm connectivity to describe existing and new spatial conservation prioritization techniques that aim to promote the persistence of processes that operate between realms.},

	abstract = {The terms \&quot;sustainability\&quot; and \&quot;ecotourism\&quot; have become much used in recent years, yet there have been few examinations of how they might apply in practical cases. Kaikoura, a small coastal town (population 3600) on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island, has a rapidly developing tourism industry. This industry has helped to transform the town from an economically depressed area with few opportunities for local employment into one of New Zealand's \&quot;boom towns\&quot;. However, this growth has not been without costs and controversies. The development of a successful ecotourism business by local indigenous Maori has caused some resentment amongst residents, and there is evidence that the marine mammals targeted by the tourism industry are experiencing increasing pressure. As a consequence, researchers and local people recognise that sustainability is an important issue for the future of the area. This case study provides important insights into the challenges associated with the rapid growth of an ecotourism destination.},

This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.},

Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.},

	abstract = {The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

This is particularly true of point pattern data (in which the primary data are the locations at which target species are found), but also true of gridded data, and of georeferenced samples from continuous spatial fields. We describe here the R package inlabru that builds on the widely used RINLA package to provide easier access to Bayesian inference from spatial point process, spatial count, gridded, and georeferenced data, using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA, Rue et al., 2009). The package provides methods for fitting spatial density surfaces and estimating abundance, as well as for plotting and prediction. It accommodates data that are points, counts, georeferenced samples, or distance sampling data. This paper describes the main features of the package, illustrated by fitting models to the gorilla nest data contained in the package spatstat (Baddeley, \& Turner, 2005), a line transect survey dataset contained in the package dsm (Miller, Rexstad, Burt, Bravington, \& Hedley, 2018), and to a georeferenced sample from a simulated continuous spatial field.},

	abstract = {With over a million software users worldwide, and installations at over 5,000 universities, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI), established in 1969, is a world leader for the design and development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. GIS technology allows the organization, manipulation, analysis, and visualization of spatial data, often uncovering relationships, patterns, and trends. It is an important tool for urban planning (Maantay and Ziegler 2006), public health (Cromley and McLafferty 2002), law enforcement (Chainey and Ratcliffe 2005), ecology (Johnston 1998), transportation (Thill 2000), demographics (Peters and MacDonald 2004), resource management (Pettit et al. 2008), and many other industries (see http://www.esri.com/industries.html). Traditional GIS analysis techniques include spatial queries, map overlay, buffer analysis, interpolation, and proximity calculations (Mitchell 1999). Along with basic cartographic and data management tools, these analytical techniques have long been a foundation for geographic information software. Tools to perform spatial analysis have been extended over the years to include geostatistical techniques (Smith et al. 2006), raster analysis (Tomlin 1990), analytical methods for business (Pick 2008), 3D analysis (Abdul-Rahman et al. 2006), network analytics (Okabe et al. 2006), space-time dynamics (Peuquet 2002), and techniques specific to a variety of industries (e.g., Miller and Shaw 2001). In 2004, a new set of spatial statistics tools designed to describe feature patterns was added to ArcGIS 9. This chapter focuses on the methods and models found in the Spatial Statistics toolbox.},

Our ability to monitor the state of biodiversity and the impacts of global environmental change on this natural capital is fundamental to designing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for preventing further loss of biological diversity. This requires the scientific community to assess spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature, rainfall) and in the distribution, structure, composition and functioning of ecosystems. The potential for satellite remote sensing (SRS) to provide key data has been highlighted by many researchers, with SRS offering repeatable, standardized and verifiable information on long-term trends in biodiversity indicators. SRS permits one to address questions on scales inaccessible to ground-based methods alone, facilitating the development of an integrated approach to natural resource management, where biodiversity, pressures to biodiversity and consequences of management decisions can all be monitored. Synthesis and applications. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the prospects of satellite remote sensing (SRS) for ecological applications, reviewing established avenues and highlighting new research and technological developments that have a high potential to make a difference in environmental management. We also discuss current barriers to the ecological application of SRS-based approaches and identify possible ways to overcome some of these limitations.},

Spatial autocorrelation refers to the pattern in which observations from nearby locations are more likely to have similar magnitude than by chance alone. The magnitude, intensity, as well as extent of spatial autocorrelation can be quantified using spatial statistics. Most ecological data exhibit some degree of spatial autocorrelation, depending on the scale at which the data were recorded and then analyzed. Ecological phenomena are also characterized by the multiple ecological processes that act upon them; these processes often operate at more than one spatial scale. Ecological data are a composite of several spatial scales: trends at macroscales; patches, gradients and patterns at meso- and local scales; and random patterns at local and microscales. The different processes and patterns at different scales are not necessarily linear or additive, and this contributes to the degree of spatial dependence in the data.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in spatial analysis to help in their choice of techniques. It uses examples to compare methods of spatial analysis for ecological field data. A taxonomy of different data types is presented, including point- and area-referenced data, with and without attributes. Spatially and non-spatially explicit data are distinguished. The effects of sampling and other transformations that convert one data type to another are discussed; the possible loss of spatial information is considered. Techniques for analyzing spatial pattern, developed in plant ecology, animal ecology, landscape ecology, geostatistics and applied statistics are reviewed briefly and their overlap in methodology and philosophy noted. The techniques are categorized according to their output and the inferences that may be drawn from them, in a discursive style without formulae. Methods are compared for four case studies with field data covering a range of types. These are: 1) percentage cover of three shrubs along a line transect; 2) locations and volume of a desert plant in a 1 ha area; 3) a remotely-sensed spectral index and elevation from 105 km2 of a mountainous region; and 4) land cover from three rangeland types within 800 km2 of a coastal region. Initial approaches utilize mapping, frequency distributions and variance-mean indices. Analysis techniques we compare include: local quadrat variance, block quadrat variance, correlograms, variograms, angular correlation, directional variograms, wavelets, SADIE, nearest neighbour methods, Ripley's (t), and various landscape ecology metrics. Our advice to ecologists is to use simple visualization techniques for initial analysis, and subsequently to select methods that are appropriate for the data type and that answer their specific questions of interest. It is usually prudent to employ several different techniques.},

	abstract = {Consider a Markov chain defined on a finite state space, X, that leaves invariant the uniform distribution on X, and whose transition probabilities are integer multiples of 1/Q, for some integer Q. I show how a simulation of n transitions of this chain starting at x\_0 can be viewed as applying a random permutation on the space XxU, where U=\{0,1,...,Q-1\}, to the start state (x\_0,u\_0), with u\_0 drawn uniformly from U. This result can be applied to a non-uniform distribution with probabilities that are integer multiples of 1/P, for some integer P, by representing it as the marginal distribution for X from the uniform distribution on a suitably-defined subset of XxY, where Y=\{0,1,...,P-1\}. By letting Q, P, and the cardinality of X go to infinity, this result can be generalized to non-rational probabilities and to continuous state spaces, with permutations on a finite space replaced by volume-preserving one-to-one maps from a continuous space to itself. These constructions can be efficiently implemented for chains commonly used in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. I present two applications in this context - simulation of K realizations of a chain from K initial states, but with transitions defined by a single stream of random numbers, as may be efficient with a vector processor or multiple processors, and use of MCMC to improve an importance sampling distribution that already has substantial overlap with the distribution of interest. I also discuss the implications of this "permutation MCMC" method regarding the role of randomness in MCMC simulation, and the potential use of non-random and quasi-random numbers.},

To apply the proposed method, one only needs to be able to maximize slightly modified likelihood functions and to evaluate the observed information at the maxima. Nevertheless, the resulting approximations are generally as accurate and in some cases more accurate than approximations based on third-order expansions of the likelihood and requiring the evaluation of third derivatives. The approximate marginal posterior densities behave very much like saddle-point approximations for sampling distributions. The principal regularity condition required is that the likelihood times prior be unimodal.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

We discuss how to build systems of SPDEs that introduces oscillation characteristics in the covariance functions of the multivariate GRFs. By choosing diﬀerent parametrization of the equations, some GRFs can be made with oscillating covariance functions but other ﬁelds can have Mat´ern covariance functions or close to Mat´ern covariance functions. The multivariate GRFs constructed by solving the systems of SPDEs automatically fulﬁll the hard requirement of nonnegative deﬁniteness for the covariance functions. The approximate weak solutions to the systems of SPDEs are used to represent the multivariate GRFs by multivariate Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds (GMRFs). Since the multivariate GMRFs have sparse precision matrices (inverse of the covariance matrices), numerical algorithms for sparse matrices can be applied to the precision matrices for sampling and inference. Thus from a computational point of view, the big-n problem can be partially solved with these types of models. Another advantage of the method is that the oscillation in the covariance function can be controlled directly by the parameters in the system of SPDEs. We show how to use this proposed approach with simulated data and real data examples.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

	abstract = {Aerial surveys are used to document the distribution and relative abundance of Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and to assess population trends. Recent research included aerial surveys by various agencies to determine the distributions of manatees in 10 areas of Florida. In most of these studies, twice-monthly flights were made for at least 2 years. Surveys of distributions have now been made in all areas of the state that are extensively used by manatees. The resulting data have been used for the protection of manatees. Various groups conducted counts of manatees at aggregation sites in winter at selected power plants and at the Crystal River and Blue Spring. These counts have been used to assess population-size trends. Based on mandates by the state legislature, a 2-day, synoptic aerial survey was made to obtain a single annual high count by maximizing survey effort under optimal conditions. These surveys followed two major cold fronts each winter in 1991 and 1992. On 17-18 January 1992, a high count of I,856 manatees was made (907 on the eastern coast, 949 on the western coast, 8.7\% calves). Although not statistical estimates, these counts provide new information about the minimum size ofthe population. The higher synoptic-survey counts are not proof of an increase of the population through time but are consistent with increases in long-term counts in some areas of the state, including aerial counts at the Crystal River, ground counts at Blue Spring, and counts of aggregations at power plants adjusted for temperature covariates. Current research on aerial surveys is focused on new techniques to improve estimates of population size and trend.},

By using direct spatial correlation structures the “effective range” (i.e., the distance at which there is no lingering spatial correlation) is estimated. Full Bayes hierarchical models with direct spatial correlation effects and conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial effects are estimated. The model of crash, traffic, and roadway inventory data from Pennsylvania shows an average effective range of around 168 m which is in line with previous findings from conditional models. The direct spatial correlation model has a better goodness of fit than the random effects and the CAR model. Furthermore, the proportion of variation in the data explained by the spatial correlation term is almost the same for both spatial models. The standard deviations in coefficient estimates are slightly lower for the direct spatial correlation model compared to the random effects model but significantly lower than the CAR model.},
